## Thoughts after analysis:
    1. Income level of the employee seems to play a huge role in attrition. Almost all the employees left the company seems to earn <$5000 with marketing background being greater than 6500$
    2. We can see from the visualization that if the employees field of education differs from his job role the employees are more prone to leave the company. Most of these employees seem to have degrees in medical and technical departments.
    3. Employees with almost 2 years of experience under same manager and has the same amount of experience left the company more thn any other levels of experience. 
    4. Sales executives and lab technicians left the company more than other job roles. The bigger size of these job roles under no attrition could be because of new hires as many of the employees left the firm.
    5. Aain the general assumption would be that bigger the age, greater the chance of employees leaving but the data does not support this assumption. Most of the employees left seem to be under 35 years old. From 18 to 35 the attrition levels are very high and their distance from home is also small when compared to many other employees.
